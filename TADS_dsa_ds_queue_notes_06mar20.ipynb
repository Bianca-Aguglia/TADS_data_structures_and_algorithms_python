    "A **queue** is a data structure made of a linear collection of elements which meet the following requirement: the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed from the queue. This requirement is also known as FIFO (first in, first out). By convention, the end at which new elements are added is called back, tail, or rear of the queue, and the end at which elements are removed from the queue is called head or front of the queue.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Real life examples of FIFO situations are lines people form when waiting for their turn at a cash register, an amusement park ride, etc. "
