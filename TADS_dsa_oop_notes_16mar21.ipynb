    "**Object oriented programming** is a programming approach based on the concept of **objects**, which can have properties and behaviors. The properties are in the form of fields (also known as attributes), and the behaviors are in the form of functions (also known as procedures or methods).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Properties define the state of the object. This is the data that the object stores. This data can be a built-in type like int, or even our own custom types weâ€™ll create later.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Behaviors are the actions our object can take. Oftentimes, this involves using or modifying the properties of our object."
