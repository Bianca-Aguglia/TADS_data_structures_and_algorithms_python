    "# Bubble sort\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Bubble sort** is a sorting algorithm that steps through a list, compares its adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until no more swaps are done. The algorithm, also known as *sinking sort* or *sorting by exchange*, is named for the way larger elements bubble to the top of the list.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Bubble sort is easy to understand and to implement, so it is often used when teaching algorithms, but it performs poorly in real world applications. It has a time complexity O(n<sup>2</sup>). Because of this, it is often disparaged and there have even been recommendations to stop teaching it."
