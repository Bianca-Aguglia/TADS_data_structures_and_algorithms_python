    "    - vendors (people who supply books to the library)\n",
    "    - librarians (people who help guests, interact with vendors, organize the books)? <small>(yes to guests, vendors, librarians; add donors (people who donate books or money)</small>\n",

    "- is membership paid or free? <small>(free, guests must only register to become members)</small>\n",

    "- is there a limit to how many books a member can check out? <small>(yes, max_quantity = 10 books)</small>\n",
