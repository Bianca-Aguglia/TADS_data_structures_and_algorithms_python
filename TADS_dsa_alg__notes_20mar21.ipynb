    "In computer science, an **algorithm** is a finite, well-defined sequence of computer implementable instructions meant to accomplish a specific task or to solve a specific problem. Given an initial state, the algorithm terminates in a defined end-state. The complete set of instances an algorithm has to work on and the desired output of the algorithm are described in what is called the **algorithmic problem**. The algorithm itself describes the steps for solving the problem."
